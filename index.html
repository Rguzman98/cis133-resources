    <p>This video was very insightful for me because the eductor broke down step by step what html was and how to get started. She screen recorded step by step on how to get started and being a visual learner seeing it done on screen was easier for me to obtain.</p>

    <p>I also enjoyed how the video was formatted in this youtube tutorial explainig css as a styling language. I loved that they explained that css is creativity focused and the different options you can go with depending on what you are trying to design.</p>
